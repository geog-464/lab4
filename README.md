# lab4

You can view the instructions for this lab in *lab4.ipynb*.

You can run the lab locally on your computer (recommended) or online in the cloud.

- To run the lab **locally**:
  - clone the repository to your machine (instructions for doing this are available in [lab1](https://github.com/geog-464/lab1).
- To run the lab **online**:
  - Once you have forked this lab by using the Github Classroom link, go to your Github repository settings and make your repository *Public*.
  - Paste your repo URL at [binder.org](https://mybinder.org/) and click **launch**. This will launch a temporary online Jupyter Lab server, but be mindful of the following:
    - Changes cannot be saved like in a regular Jupyter notebook: if you close the web browser tab, all changes will be lost.
    - However, you can still use git, which can serve as a way of saving your work (i.e. push frequently).
      - Note however that you will need to [configure your username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) and [email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-email-address-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) like you would after a fresh install of git on your computer.
